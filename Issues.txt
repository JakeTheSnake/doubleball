TODO:

Add setting of route to UI for adding global objects
When an action has been selected, remove mutually exclusive actions from list.
As the save/load functionality works now, people can embed any script they want into the game. We probably need to save actions by name instead of saving entire functions. And interpret this to recreate a usable object when the game is loaded.
How do we handle selection of actions on collision events on the mouse object? Bounce and stop make no sense on this.
Need to handle initialization of objects that have different runtime  values. (topDown and platform objects have facing for example, though maybe all objects should have this...)
Can we use an anynomous function for runtime parameters for actions instead of the current parameters handling?
A platform object bouncing bounces higher and higher the longer the game goes.....

Drag and drop in edit mode is not working very well.
onDestroy should probably be a collection of functions to run when an object is destroyed. So that new actions can be bound to the event.
Clear collisionActions of empty actions when not directing, they need to be there when directing to know when a "Nothing" action is chosen for a collision.

POSSIBLES:

Alla args bör skickas in som objekt så att ordningen kvittar och man ser tydligare vad man skickar.
Vad händer om ett objekt kolliderar med två andra objekt?
Split sceneObject into different types based on global type?
Add some "Frame reset function"? (reset objectBeneath here)
