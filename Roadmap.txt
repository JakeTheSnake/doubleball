Version 0.2:

- Render Optimization (Test on different platforms)

- Scene properties (Background).
	-Background in separate canvas layer.

- Object states (tabs under properties for the global object, preferably nameable)
	Tricky. What attributes should be governed by state?
	SpeedX/SpeedY can't really be set by state as that would mess stuff up...
	Make img src changeable.
    	Actions:
    		-Change Object States

- Fix Issue #7

- Backend

DONE:
-Unique Objects
-Scene managing

Actions:
    -Switch Scene
